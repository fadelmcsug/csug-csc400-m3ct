# Big-Oh Exercise
In this exercise, a method is developed to search for a missing number in an array of length n and containing unique and ranomly sorted numbers in the range from 1 to n + 1, such that one integer in this range is missing from the array.

The method developed uses linear search with a Big-Oh of O(n).
